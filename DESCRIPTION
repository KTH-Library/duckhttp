Description: The duckdb database engine has an extension called httpserver which allows
    remote clients to issue queries against a REST API providing JSON over http(s).
    This R package provides a function to issue queries to such remote duckdb instances
    and get results back in tabular form. It also provides a couple of functions to
    enable Arrow Flight SQL database connections to remote servers.
